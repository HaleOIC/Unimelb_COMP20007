# COMP20007 Algorithm design

THis is a course offered by the University of Melbourne in the field of computer science. It covers topics such as algorithms, data structures, computer organization, and more. The course aims to provide students with a solid foundation in computer science principles and practical skills that can be applied in a variety of contexts. Through lectures, tutorials, and assignments, students will develop their ability to design, implement, and analyze algorithms and data structures, as well as gain an understanding of how computers work at a low level. There are two assignments in this course, and each of them have two subprojects.

- [x] Assignment1
- [x] Assignment2

You can have a fully understanding of the basic algorithm insight and have the power to design new self-defined algorithm in the following courses.

- `./turtorials`: contains my understanding and solutions for the tutorials provided in the course
- `./slides`: contains the slides used in the lecture with some my own notations
- `./Assignment`: contains two assignments I have finished during the course, both of which has gained the professor praise.
- `./exams` contain the midterm and final sample tests for myself learning.
